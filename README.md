# owu!  (fork of Webosu)

A fork of a browser rhythm game where players click circles following rhythm of the music.

Made possible with [PixiJS](https://www.pixijs.com). Beatmap API: [Sayobot](https://osu.sayobot.cn).

Note: Some music might not be perfectly synced and modes other than osu! (standard) are unsupported.

The main thing I did to tweak this project is I translated the Chinese to English and hosted it myself

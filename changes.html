                    <h3>4/25/2021 | 5:36am - Arc.io CDN</h3>
                    Because I couldn't do anything with the Live Plays idea I atleast tried to do something useful, so I implemented Arc.io CDN.
                    Basically what it does is it makes your exxperience faster and makes me some money! Its a win-win. Thats it from me.<br><br>
                    <h4>Updates</h4>>
                    - Arc CDN Integrated

                    <h3>4/25/2021 5:10am - Live Plays</h3>
                    So, I was going to make a live plays section but, I have a limited hosting capabilities
                    at the time being and it seems impossible from a technical standpoint, at some point I'd like to set up a server for this site
                    and buy subdomains/domains to run a custom API but right now its just not happening, I'll add a donation link sometime tomorrow
                    anything going to that would be put *directly* into funds for bettering the site.<br>
                    As for changes, there is none, thanks for checking the changelog!

                    <h3>4/24/2021 - Initial Log entry and some updates</h3>
                    First off this is *the* very first changelog entry consider yourself cool if you see it<br>
                    Second off, this started as a little project to keep me busy when I saw it posted on github in chinese and a shitty theme
                    so, I imported and got to work now its a project I plan to uphold for a while.<br><br>
                    <h4>Updates</h4>
                    - Fixed "Load More" buttons and the sort tab, lol<br>
                    - Edited the theme a little, I think it looks good now
